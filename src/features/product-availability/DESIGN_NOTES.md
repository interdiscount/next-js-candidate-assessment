## Architecture Choices

Briefly explain your architectural decisions:

### 1. Code Organization
_How did you organize your code? (e.g., separate files for components/hooks/utils, one file, etc.)_

Example: "I split components, hooks, and utilities into separate folders because..."

---

### 2. Data Fetching Strategy
_Why did you choose your data fetching approach?_

Example: "I used SWR because..." or "I used useEffect + fetch because..."

---

### 3. State Management
_How did you manage state? Why?_

Example: "I kept all state in the parent component because..." or "I created custom hooks because..."

---

### 4. Trade-offs
_What trade-offs did you consider?_

Example: "I chose simplicity over performance because..." or "I optimized for X at the cost of Y because..."

### 5. Edge Cases
_What edge cases did you consider (empty products, fetch errors, zero stock, etc.) and how did you handle them?_

**Note:** This doesn't need to be long. 2-3 sentences per section is fine. We want to understand your thinking, not read an essay.
